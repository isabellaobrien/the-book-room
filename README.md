# THE BOOK ROOM

The book room is a website for a London based book club that also incorporates the aspects of a tea room. The book room is for anyone that loves reading or would like to make reading a habit.

On the book room  users can access all the information they need. They can find out about our book club, when and where our multiple monthly meet ups will take place  and which desert theyâ€™ll have accompanied by tea. In addition they'll also have access to our contact information and our sign up form.
