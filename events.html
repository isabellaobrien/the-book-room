        <h2>Our events</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of the month we meet up to choose the book we will read for the month.We always leave some suggestions on our site, but we are very open to our members' suggestions as well.
            We will then meet a couple of times over the month to chat about the chapters we’ve read over tea and cake. 
            We want to make sure that everyone gets the chance to say what they think. 
            We want everyone to feel as comfortable as possible, so there is  no pressure to express your opinion in front of everyone if you don’t feel like it. You can simply come and listen to what other people have to say.
            </p>

            <div class="book"> 
                <p>The acclaimed story of two women and the strength of their bond in the racist society of 1980s America. 
                The Color Purple won the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, deservedly making Alice Walker the first
                African-American woman to receive the award.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="book">
                <p>Pi Patel is only a young boy when his freighter to North America sinks and he’s stuck on a
                small lifeboat with an orangutan, a hyena — and a tiger. Dramatic, humorous, and thoughtful,
                Yann Martel’s book made waves when it was published in 2001.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="book">
                <p>The source of film and TV adaptations, sequels, and several hundred reimaginings,
                    Pride and Prejudice is one of the cornerstones of English literature. Through wit,
                    sarcasm, and humor, this 19th-century novel centers on the five unmarried (gasp!)
                    Bennet sisters while exploring themes of family, society, and, yes, love.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="book">
                <p>In the town of Comala, where ghosts are indistinguishable from the living, young Juan 
                    Preciado goes to look for his estranged father. In his only published novel, Rulfo weaves
                    together a story that’s told in such a way that readers are left wondering who’s truly alive 
                    and who's dead — and whether there’s more to the town than first meets the eye.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="book">
                <p>A young and distressed woman dressed entirely in white one day appears to Walter Hartright,
                    kicking off the plot of The Woman in White, often described as one of the finest mystery 
                    novels ever written.  </p>
